# Surf's Up
## Overview
### *Purpose of the Analysis*
Someone who wants to open a combination surf shop and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu has asked me to analyze June temperatures and December temperatures over several years in order to feel more confident as he approaches potential investors in his enterprise that the weather in his desired location will be conducive to a business so focused on the outdoors.
## Results
### *Three Key Differences*
- The highest temperature recorded in June at the various Oahu weather stations was 85 degrees, whereas the highest December temperature at those same stations was 83 degrees. There is only a slight difference in the highest maximum between June and December.
- The lowest temperature recorded in June at the Oahu weather stations was 64 degrees, while the lowest December temperature recorded there was 56 degrees. So there is a slightly greater difference between June and December in the cool early morning temperatures that mark the daily low.
- The mean temperature is the average of all of the hourly observations at all of the weather stations on Oahu in June and in December. As a single figure it gives an insight into what temperatures are like for the month. The mean temperature for June is 74.944118 degrees. The mean for December is 71.041529. So very little variation is documented in the mean temperature of June and December.

## Summary
### *High-Level Summary*
The temperature data I have collected so far establishes clearly that the temperatures around the location of the proposed surf and ice cream shop stay very close to the low 70s day and night, so the temperatures are very agreeable for people who want to surf and eat ice cream. It seems to be a place of perpetual summer.
### *Additional Queries*
- Since sunshine would be a good accompaniment to surfing and eating ice cream, I suggest running a query about the weather conditions in June and December. I could determine how many hourly observations are either clear or partly cloudy, and how many are overcast or rainy.
- Rain would discourage most people from surfing and would greatly lower ice cream sales, so I would propose running a separate query on precipitation data. In addition to the daily precipitation measurement, it seems useful to get the number of hours in which measureable precipitation fell in June and in December. That query would provide a better understanding of how much of a day is likely to be rainy.
